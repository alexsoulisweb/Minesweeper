Minesweeper.java INSTRUCTIONS (for compiling and running)	@author Brandon Canaday

These are instructions on how to compile and run the Minesweeper.java program from the terminal, assuming
the user is starting in the same directory as Minesweeper.java.

1) Enter the command 'javac Minesweeper.java'. This will compile the program and create a Minesweeper.class
   in the same directory.

2) To run the program with seed file input, enter the command 'java Minesweeper [name of seed file]', which
   in this case would be the command 'java Minesweeper seed1.txt'. This will run the program according to 
   input read in from the file.

3) To run the program with user input, enter the command 'java Minesweeper [rows] [columns]', where "rows"
   is the user's desired number of rows for the minesweeper grid to contain and "columns" is the user's
   desired number of columns for the minesweeper grid to contain. Neither number can be less than 0 or 
   greater than 10. 
   
   Ex. 'java Minesweeper 10 10', or 'java Minesweeper 5 5'

4) ENJOY!
